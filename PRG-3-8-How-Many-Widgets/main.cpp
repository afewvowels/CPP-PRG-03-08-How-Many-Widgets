//  The Yukon Widget Company manufactures widgets that weigh 12.5 pounds each.
//  Write a program that calculates how many widgets are stacked on a pallet, based on
//  the total weight of the pallet. The program should ask the user how much the pallet
//  weighs by itself and with the widgets stacked on it. It should then calculate and display
//  the number of widgets stacked on the pallet.
